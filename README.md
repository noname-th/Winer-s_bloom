# ❄️ Winter's Bloom

A minimal adventure game with visual novel elements — players will guide a mysterious little girl named **Eira** through a silent, desolate world in the harsh winter. Everything responds, but no one explains anything.

There is no voice acting, no dialogue — only ambient sounds, emotional cues, and "you," the player, who is outside the screen, offering warmth and comfort to the lonely child in this world. A day will come when spring arrives, and the flowers will bloom once again 🌸.
